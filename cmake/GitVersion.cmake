# GitVersion

# Version derived from the repository's own git tags (https://semver.org/).
#
# GIT_VERSION_FULL   - The full, honest version string: a MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
#                      triple, plus the commit distance and abbreviated hash
#                      when the tree is past the tag that distance is measured
#                      from (`5.0.0-38-gda5a00c`), plus `-dirty` when the
#                      working tree has uncommitted changes. Exactly a bare
#                      triple ONLY on a tagged commit with a clean tree.
#
#                      The triple is the NEWER of the nearest release tag and
#                      the VERSION file (see the note further down), so during
#                      a development cycle it is VERSION's while the distance
#                      and hash still count from the older tag. That pairing is
#                      the point: the number says which release this tree is
#                      heading for, and the suffix says it has not arrived.
# GIT_VERSION_MAJOR  - Major component of the leading numeric triple
# GIT_VERSION_MINOR  - Minor component
# GIT_VERSION_PATCH  - Patch component
#
# The numeric triple is the *only* thing that may feed `project(VERSION ...)`,
# CMake's own version comparisons and the macOS bundle version keys: all three
# reject a suffix. The full string is what user-facing banners show, because a
# development build that prints a bare release number is claiming to be a
# release it is not.
#
# "The repository's OWN tags" is load-bearing and is checked rather than assumed
# — see the ownership test below. Nothing here is allowed to fail the configure:
# every way of answering the question degrades to the next one and the last
# resort is a constant, because a version string is a label on the build, never
# a precondition for producing it.
#
# The stamp is refreshed by re-running configure, and the git state that feeds it
# is registered in CMAKE_CONFIGURE_DEPENDS so that happens on its own when the
# commit or the working tree moves. Without that registration the FIRST configure
# of a build tree froze the answer: the build stayed up to date, the generator
# reported no work to do, and the banner went on naming a commit the tree had
# long left behind — `-dirty` marker and all, on a clean checkout.

# against, and a source drop inside a foreign repository is refused the
# enclosing repo's tags above — for all of them `git describe` cannot answer
# and the committed VERSION file is the only version there is. A DEVELOPMENT
# checkout has the opposite problem: describe answers with the PREVIOUS release
# for the whole cycle, so between code freeze (VERSION bumped) and the tag the
# build stamps the OLD major while VERSION, the CHANGELOG and the packaging all
# state the new one. Measured on this repository: VERSION, the deb/rpm metadata
# and the changelog said 5.0.0 while project(), the About window, the startup
# log line and the macOS bundle keys said 4.2.0 — on every push, before any
# tag, and the package job labelled the artefact with the number the sources
# did not carry.
#
# So VERSION is not a fallback, it is a floor: it carries the version this tree
# is heading for and is bumped at code freeze. The tag still wins on the
# release commit (equal) and on any checkout whose tag is ahead of VERSION.
# Only the leading triple is taken from it, and of what describe appended only
# what still describes THIS tree: the commit distance, the abbreviated hash and
# the dirty marker are kept, so a development build goes on saying it is one
# instead of introducing itself as the release. A pre-release LABEL is dropped,
# because it belonged to the older tag: carrying `4.0.0-rc2` across a 5.0.0
# VERSION would announce a release candidate of a version that never had one.
